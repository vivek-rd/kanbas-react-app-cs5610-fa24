        <h4>Heading Tags</h4>
        Text documents are often broken up into several sections and
        subsections. Each section is usually prefaced with a short title or
        heading that attempts to summarize the topic of the section it precedes.
        For instance this paragraph is preceded by the heading Heading Tags. The
        font of the section headings are usually larger and bolder than their
        subsection headings. This document uses headings to introduce topics
        such as HTML Documents, HTML Tags, Heading Tags, etc. HTML heading tags
        can be used to format plain text so that it renders in a browser as
        large headings. There are 6 heading tags for different sizes: h1, h2,
        h3, h4, h5, and h6. Tag h1 is the largest heading and h6 is the smallest
        heading.

          the paragraph above and this paragraph, by default browsers render
          them as one contiguous piece of text as shown here on the right. This
          is the third paragraph. Wrap each paragraph with the paragraph tag to
          tell browsers to render the gaps.

        How to make biryani:
        <ol id="wd-your-favorite-recipe">
          <li>
            Marinate the chicken: Place the yogurt, garlic, ginger, lemon juice,
            salt, garam masala, chile powder, turmeric and green chile (if
            using) in a large bowl. Stir to combine and taste, adjusting salt if
            necessary. The flavors should be bold and pleasantly spicy. Make a
            shallow slit in the thickest part of the drumsticks. Add the chicken
            to the marinade and mix until coated. Cover and marinate in the
            refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight. Remove
            the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare the fried onion: Line a large plate with paper towels and
            set aside. Cut the onion in half, then lengthwise into ¼-inch-thick
            slices, discarding any smaller pieces that may burn. In a large
            (12-inch) deep skillet with a lid, heat the oil over medium-high,
            add the onion in an even layer (a little overlapping is fine) and
            cook without touching, until the onions around the sides of the pan
            start to color, about 4 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scoot the onions on the sides of the pan to the center, reduce the
            heat to medium and continue frying, stirring frequently, until
            golden brown and some are crisp, about 6 minutes more. The onion
            will keep cooking and turn darker off the heat. Season with salt,
            add the turmeric and stir for 20 seconds. Remove the pan from the
            heat and transfer the onion to the prepared plate with a slotted
            spoon. Do not discard the oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook the chicken: Place the pan with the oil over medium and add the
            cardamom, cloves, bay leaf, star anise and cinnamon stick. Stir
            until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the drumsticks (save the
            marinade) and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook, turning once,
            until the chicken takes on a little color, 2 to 3 minutes on each
            side. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in the marinade and 2
            tablespoons of water. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until
            the chicken is just cooked through and the gravy is thick, 20 to 25
            minutes. If the chicken is cooked but the gravy hasn’t thickened,
            remove the drumsticks and increase the heat to medium-high; cook
            until thickened. Taste and adjust seasoning, if needed, then return
            drumsticks to the skillet. Remove the pan from the heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare the rice: In a large (5-quart) pot or Dutch oven that you
            plan on using for the biryani, add 10 cups of water, the cardamom,
            cloves, bay leaves, star anise and cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil
            over high. Add salt and stir to dissolve; carefully taste and add
            more if needed (it should be pleasantly salty). Drain the soaked
            rice and add it to the boiling water, giving it a quick stir;
            par-cook the rice until it’s tender on the outside but has a bite, 5
            to 8 minutes. Drain and sprinkle it with a little cold water to stop
            the cooking, then set aside to drain completely. (The rice should
            not sit in a pool of water as it drains.) Give the rice pot a quick
            rinse and dry it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assemble the biryani: In a small bowl, heat the milk in the
            microwave until warm, about 20 seconds. Crumble the saffron threads
            between your fingers as you add them to the warm milk. Stir in the
            rose water, if using. In the rice pot, melt the ghee over medium
            heat, then transfer half to a small bowl. Transfer ⅓ of the rice and
            the whole spices to the biryani pot and gently pat it down. Transfer
            the drumsticks to the pot, then add the gravy and whole spices.
            Scatter ⅓ of the onion and ⅓ of the herbs over the chicken. Add
            another ⅓ of rice, top with another ⅓ of the onion, ⅓ of the herb
            mixture and drizzle with half of the saffron milk. Layer with the
            remaining rice, fried onion and herbs, and drizzle with the
            remaining saffron milk and ghee.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover and cook for 10 minutes. Remove the lid and wrap it with a
            clean, thin dish towel or a couple of paper towels, making sure the
            ends are tied at the top, in order to get a good seal and catch
            extra condensation. Return the lid and reduce heat to low; cook for
            20 minutes. Remove from the heat and rest for 10 minutes with the
            lid on the pot. Serve with mint leaves and pomegranate seeds, if
            using.
